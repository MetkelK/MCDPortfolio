			<p class="mb-2">Srigley, Katrina. Breadwinning Daughters Young Working Women in a Depression-Era City, 1929-1939. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2010. 206 pages.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">Katrina Srigley’s book, Breadwinning Daughters: Young Working Women in a Depression-Era City, 1929-1939, presents an important history of young female workers in 1930s Toronto. Srigley begins by situating her reader in the wider history of the era, detailing the economic hardships faced by families and explaining the various socio-economic reasons that women entered the workforce. Using personal stories from female interviewees, Srigley paints a vivid portrait of life in the interwar period. Her approach is intersectional, examining these women’s experiences and addressing how factors such as class, race and family history made them varied and complex. Building on the wealth of women’s history in this time period from authors such as Veronica Strong-Boag, Tamara Myers and Cynthia Comacchio, Srigley brings the conventional history of the Depression era into conversation with oral history interviews conducted with female Torontonian workers. Because Srigley posits her feminist work as a historical recovery project, she is successful in her localized approach to an important story of women’s work opportunities, experiences and identities in the 1930s.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">As male labour opportunities became hard to find, 1930s families increasingly turned to their daughters’ wages as important, or central, contributions to the family income. The financial stressors of the Depression, and the social standards set for women, “forced women to negotiate these expectations carefully, and to make sacrifices they did not anticipate.”(p. 17) Maintaining a respectable image took many forms, including dressing in a ‘feminine’ way, quitting work after marriage, and leaving formal education. Contemporary social concerns centered around the effects of the Depression on the ideal family, not women as individuals. This point showcases how studies like Srigley’s are vital to a nuanced understanding of the era. Srigley demonstrates the “elastic” roles that family members played within the home, with mothers, daughters and sons entering the workforce or scavenging to make money. Sometimes the gendered landscape of the household was transgressed as unemployed men took up domestic tasks. More frequently, women maintained their domestic work as well as their jobs outside the home.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">Depression-era women found employment in various areas. Gendered hierarchies generally kept men in higher paid and more powerful positions, yet new openings in the labour market led to pay increases and upward mobility for some women. Statistically, the most likely source of employment was domestic labour, particularly for marginalized women such as immigrants or married women. Increasingly, the feminization of the clerical sector meant that numerous women were employed in offices. Themes of respectability and desirability emerge again here, with racist hiring practices across different sectors promoting the ideal worker as white, middle class and single. Stories about wages and hiring and firing practices demonstrate how employment discrimination functioned towards women, especially women of colour.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">Women’s safety was a popular topic in Torontonian media during the Depression years. Srigley argues that there was a disparity between perceived dangers and women’s actual experiences. Women who did not meet certain moral standards could be blamed for crimes committed against them, while women who were considered respectable were also thought to be “vulnerable.” (p. 83) Ruth Taylor’s brutal murder following a late night shift at Toronto General Trusts brought all of these elements into sharp focus. Though she was considered a “good girl,” some blamed her for walking alone at night. The interviewees tell many personal narratives of sexual harassment and abuse in both the workplace and the home, challenging the idea that danger lurked only when they left home. Srigley concludes by arguing that though the Depression limited leisure time, young working women found ways to exercise their agency through dancing, dating, going to the movies and various other affordable outlets. By participating in these activities, women balanced their public images with their desires and constantly negotiated their identities as family members, working girls, lovers, and friends.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">By situating herself in the story early on, Srigley borders on using a creative nonfiction approach to writing history. In an intriguing and relatable meditation on oral histories, she writes that “the generational divide [between her and the interviewees] shaped memories and could act as a silencer.”(p. 11) Through this commentary and numerous other references to herself throughout the book, Srigley positions herself in the narrative. The recent move towards creative nonfiction in historical writing, for example by Kate Brown in her work Plutopia: Nuclear Families, Atomic Cities, and the Great Soviet and American Plutonium Disasters, emphasizes setting the scene and encourages personal reflections on conducting oral histories.[1] While Srigley does not go as far as Brown in this endeavour, she does make a point of referencing when and where she conducted her interviews. This act of situating the interview in time and place also allows her to reflect on the emotions at play in the process, and provides more insight into memory-making. Srigley writes of Margaret Gairns talking about her rising wages: “Banging her hand on the table for emphasis, she said: “I jumped to $1800 a year and thought I was a millionaire!” she said with laughter.” (45) This image brings the reader into the physical space of the interview, and conveys the emotive process of oral history “life review,” which Srigley discusses in her introduction (p. 10). Later, when interviewing Helen Wilks about the family circumstances that prohibited her from attending an academic high school, Srigley writes that Wilks had “tears slipping discreetly from her eyes.” (p. 31) These are important details about the processing of remembering and storytelling that cannot be gleaned from written sources.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">Using over one hundred interviews, court records, newspapers, census data and a wealth of family photographs provided by interviewees, Srigley’s book walks the reader from a broad societal overview into the family home, then to the workplace, and finally onto the streets. However, there was a surprising lack of connection to the physical geography of Toronto. Toronto streets and places are sometimes cited in reference to work places, commutes, and in the Ruth Taylor case, to crime, but the geography of the city as a whole does not figure prominently. Srigley does not provide maps that could have strengthened the reader’s connections to the space her interviewees inhabited. In histories broaching similar themes, such as Elise Chenier’s work on sexual relationships between Chinese men and white women in twentieth century Toronto and Becki Ross and Kim Greenwell’s article on the performativity of striptease in Vancouver, urban geography becomes the basis for their arguments.[2] Placing their stories in a spatial setting, they convey important points about physical divides and places of discomfort and comfort.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">In short, Srigley’s Breadwinning Daughters is a vital contribution to a growing intersectional twentieth-century historiography. The strength of her book is that she posits it as the beginning of a history, writing that “there remains much to be done on issues of resistance and protest, domestic violence, and the stories of Aboriginal women and women of colour.” (p. 131) Writing a history that has surprisingly not been addressed in such depth before, Srigley opens the door for historians to build on the work she has started here. By situating herself in the narrative, Srigley may push fellow historians to consider the spaces and communities that they have access to, and to write accompanying histories that add even more diverse and important stories to the Depression era historiography.</p>

			<h2 class="text-base font-bold mb-4">Multiple Narratives of Truth, Love and Mau Mau in Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o’s A Grain of Wheat</h2>

			<p class="mb-2">We often think of political change as being set on the public stage. Ngugi’s 1967 novel A Grain of Wheat, brings his reader down to earth and reminds us of the inherent individuality of political struggle. Ngugi’s text addresses the complexities of Kenyan politics on the eve of Uhuru, or 1964 independence. In order to avoid generalizations and the use of Ngugi’s characters as complete representations of Kenya’s political divides, this essay will instead explore Ngugi’s clever use of memory differentiation in his storytelling, and how he uses it to describe Kenyan life on the eve of independence. The intersecting stories set in Thabai are retold with contradictory explanations and motivations by different characters. By presenting his reader with multiple versions of the same story, Ngugi complicates the post-colonial government’s myth of nationalism and the nature of Mau Mau itself. Using three of these stories this essay will attempt to explain how Ngugi attempts to confuse so as to examine the complex nature of Kenya on the verge of independence. When we are able, through writers like Ngugi, to see both sides of the colonial encounter, we see these misunderstandings as crucial to European justification for colonization, and the ensuing complexities that come with defeating a colonial state. In Ngugi’s postcolonial novel, it is useful to see how these stories represent multiple truths, misunderstandings and realities, and help to complicate as well as unwind the depictions of the Kenyan struggle for independence from the British state. </p>

			<p class="mb-2">The first story represents a cultural misunderstanding between the British and a member of Mau Mau freedom fighters. Using the words “cultural misunderstanding,” sounds like an excuse for imperialism, which is not my aim at all. I use this term to describe this specific encounter because it accurately depicts how the two characters Koina and Dr. Lynd tell the same story from opposing viewpoints, with different values and approaches. Symbolic of their dispute is Dr. Lynd’s dog. Dr. Lynd believes that Koina is a loyal servant to her and that he shares her adoration for her dog. From her perspective, his betrayal and killing of her dog constitutes a drastic assault upon her as a person, as “cruel and barbaric” as if he had killed her. (Ngugi, 45) Koina, however, sees Dr. Lynd, her treatment of her dog and her use of her property as representing the unfair power of the British. For Koina, “independence, when finally won, would right all the wrongs, would drive the likes of Dr. Lynd and her dogs from the country.” (Ngugi, 213) When this fails to work, the sight of Dr. Lynd and her replacement dog deeply unsettles him. Operating on opposing agendas, these two characters represent a binary separation between black and white, female and male, wealthy and poor, and the list could go on. This makes the differences in their stories perhaps more predictable than the following stories I will examine, but it is still important to include them as a way of seeing how independence came at a time when these clear racial inequalities were still very much a part of the Kenyan landscape. </p>

			<p class="mb-2">The next story I want to examine is perhaps the most compelling of Ngugi’s novel. In this discussion, the story of Mumbi and Gikonyo is evocative of the destruction that the British response to Mau Mau had wreaked upon relationships. From Mumbi’s story we learn that she had always loved Gikonyo and waited for him while he was in detention (Ngugi, 150). Her experience during the Emergency is one of horrible treatment at the hands of the British trying to suppress Mau Mau contact with the village. Mumbi, along with the remaining young people of Thabai, is forced to dig a ditch around the village, has her hut burned down and watches her community starve. She tells of how when Karanja finally tells her that Gikonyo is going to be released, she “…was in a strange world, and it was like if I was mad…I let Karanja make love to me.” (Ngugi, 150) When Gikonyo, having confessed to the oath in order to come back, returns, he sees that she has born the child of another man. (Ngugi, 115) Unaware of the circumstances surrounding Mumbi’s sexual encounter with Karanja, he thinks that she has been sleeping with Karanja every night since he was taken away. (Ngugi, 117) The book ends with Gikonyo thinking, “I shall carve a woman big—big with child.” (Ngugi, 247), which indicates that he is planning to reconcile with her. Mumbi’s strength in holding her family together, and her survival itself, is paralleled to Gikonyo’s survival in the British concentration camp. The fact that their stories are different does not demonstrate, as in the first story I examined, fundamentally different beliefs and truths. The strength of both these characters to rebuild their ties that political circumstances have torn apart is in some ways a hopeful post-colonial narrative. Instead, another element needs to be analyzed in order to see how this tale connects them together more than apart. The other element is Karanja, Gikonyo’s rival and the father of Mumbi’s child. From Gikonyo and Mumbi’s first sexual encounter (Ngugi, 91), we see Karanja’s deep love for Mumbi and the intense jealousy he feels over her relationship. Gikonyo and Karanja’s rivalry is literally portrayed as a race for Mumbi. (Ngugi 90, 214) They take two different paths in the nationalist narrative, Gikonyo is taken to a camp, but Karanja, in order to stay near to Mumbi, submits to British rule and becomes a loyalist. Because Karanja is depicted as a traitor, Gikonyo and Mumbi’s story is thus tied together through their actions of resistance and loyalty to Mau Mau. Their interpretations of Mumbi’s unfaithfulness are in fact the only position on which they differ, and Ngugi uses this divergence in stories to show the reader their similarities, and how these are build around the anti-colonial struggle. </p>

			<p class="mb-2">At the core of Ngugi’s story is Mugo’s betrayal of Kihika. This is still a story of conflicting truths and misunderstandings, but in a different way than the other two, because the reader is in on the secret. We are allowed in Mugo’s head early on and realize that he was the informant, not Karanja, though we do not understand why until near the end of the novel. Ngugi uses this story as not only a framework for his novel, with a climax and a sense of conclusion at the end, but also as a demonstration of the ties that have been cut and are still fraught on the eve of Uhuru. The idea is to hang Karanja as punishment during the independence celebrations. The crowd perceptions of the truth are important not just because of how they shape the narrative and contribute to Mugo’s feelings of guilt, but because of how they are dictated by the events of the colonial encounter. At the strike of independence, Ngugi’s characters are deeply embroiled in conflicts arising out of personal differences, individual feelings, and the struggle that they have gone through for freedom from British rule. For the villagers of Thabai, and the organizers of the independence celebrations, Karanja makes sense as the traitor. He is a tool of the British, for reasons that are have been discussed above. An exchange between two freedom fighters demonstrates how rumours solidified Karanja’s guilt for the populace. General R. says to Koina, “Karanja is really our man if what you tell me about him is true.” (Ngugi, 26) Their discussion clearly states their political stance, “Traitors and collaborators must not escape revolutionary justice.” (Ngugi, 27) After Mugo has admitted to his betrayal, General R.’s message does not change, though the story has. They are no longer convicting a loyalist, but a former revolutionary who had led a hunger strike while in a concentration camp. Yet how this story changes is very important to a different kind of freedom than the Mau Mau was fighting for. Mugo describes his betrayal as “…this thing has eaten into my life all these years.” (Ngugi, 223) At the end of the novel, Ngugi writes, “He did not want to die, he wanted to live.” (Ngugi, 236) The multiple narratives of truth surrounding Kihika’s death are never a surprise for the reader and this is how Ngugi gives his reader a role, because we hold the guilt with Mugo. In this case, the multiple truths tell us more about public perception of Karanja’s colonial role and the continued reverence that Mau Mau fighters give to Kihika. It shows how conflicts within these communities have been given increased importance in the tale of Kenyan celebration and independence, and in this one instance how revenge is not against the colonizer, but actually of a peer of the freedom fighters. </p>

			<p class="mb-2">I want to conclude this paper by suggesting that not only did Ngugi negotiate this landscape of post-colonial Kenya using these stories to demonstrate the various trajectories and the complexities behind the Mau Mau Uprising, but he also uses repetition as a textual device to suggest that while these are unique stories, there may be universal truths to them. For instance, Margery and John Thompson’s relationship mirrors Mumbi and Gikonyo’s. Both tales involve another sexual encounter for the woman, and both start with the men hesitating outside their wives’ rooms. Additionally, Thompson breaks a glass in a public venue, and Margery “linked her hand in his and bravely smiled at nowhere.” (Ngugi, 166), much as Mumbi steps in to comfort Gikonyo when he breaks his arm during the race. (Ngugi, 215) At the end of the novel, the Thompsons are scheduled to go back to England, and while the war did not physically tear them apart in the same way as Gikonyo’s imprisonment did, the Thompsons’ relationship has been changed by the events in Kenya. These stories do of course diverge on important plot points, such as the fact that Margery seems to have really cared for her lover, and that Mumbi and Gikonyo are on the edge of reconciliation at the end of the novel. Yet, it is interesting that Ngugi chose to mirror these two couples, suggesting that while there are seemingly endless perceptions of reality, actual experience may be have elements of repetition. Ngugi’s characters show us multiple realities and paint a picture of Kenya in 1964 as a volatile and exciting country on the edge of a drastic change. However, Ngugi complicates whatever we have previously assumed about Mau Mau, independence or Kenya itself. By adding multiple retellings of the same stories, he adds confusion to the mix. This is best summed up in one of his sentences that he uses to describe Mumbi, seen through Gikonyo’s eyes, “Her eyes were soft and wild and submissive and defiant.” (Ngugi, 91) Examining Ngugi’s multiple retellings, this statement helps to summarize his position on the eve of independence, which is that it is possible to be many things at once. His stories, while contradictory, paint an ultimately clearer picture of Kenya on the brink of independence than the unified post-colonial government’s narrative did. In a broader post-colonial narrative, multiple stories are not only more interesting than a single one, they are crucial to starting to understand how the collision of power, cultural norms, and more simply, people. </p>

			<h2 class="text-base font-bold mb-4 mt-10">Individualism and Success in Richard Wright’s Black Boy</h2>

			<p class="mb-2">Richard Wright’s autobiography Black Boy provides a glimpse into the harsh realities that constructed his youth and formation as a radical African activist and author. We see him move from a self-proclaimed six-year-old alcoholic to an autodidactic student hungry for food and books. The books he reads and his developing talents as a writer in early life are heavy influences in his understandings of racial inequalities in the workforce, and his later political efforts to combat them. Texts by authors Booker T. Washington and W. E. B. DuBois illuminate an important backdrop for Wright’s life story. In each of these author’s works, the themes of early life experience, employment, and personal identity in society are what characterize lives of African Americans in the early 20th century.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">These are the most tangible themes, and I have chosen to focus on them because they help to define Richard Wright’s own life, yet it should be acknowledged that more abstract themes of struggle, harassment, isolation and determination also feature highly in all of the works discussed. In their political statements, DuBois and Washington push for the same causes, and eventual goal of racial equality, yet differ in their methods of achieving it. In Washington’s Atlanta Compromise speech, he calls for cooperation and accommodation with white rule, pushing for hard work until the right to full citizenship is awarded. DuBois in his Critique of Booker T. Washington, calls for immediate suffrage, rebellion and resistance by the African American population. However, as he advocates for higher education, DuBois is also implicit in the scheme to create an elitist system of the highly educated. Trying to situate Richard Wright into DuBois’ and Washington’s paradigms is an interesting task. In some ways, Wright’s life fits into Washington’s ideals, and his ideology into DuBois,’ yet overall Wright’s strident and unbreakable sense of individualism and his power of defining his own reality make him impossible to mold into one specific formula of African American identity in this time period. As Washington and DuBois develop their ideas for achieving equality through political and legal activity, Wright proposes using art and storytelling as the primary platform for creating change and progress in his own life.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">Wright’s strong feelings of resistance seem fully formed from a young age and as he educates himself, they develop more coherently into strong feelings of anger and isolation, coupled with the desire for knowledge and a safe home. His sense of inequality develops at a young age, at first through his sensory experiences of hunger and watching instances of racial discrimination. He says, “Watching the white people eat would make my empty stomach churn and I would grow vaguely angry. Why could I not eat when I was hungry? Why did I always have to wait until others were through? I could not understand why some people had enough food and others did not.” (Wright, 19)</p>

			<p class="mb-2">His immediate feelings of anger do not go away, and his identity seems to partially solidify at this point. He states, “At the age of twelve I had an attitude towards life that was to endure, that was to make me seek those areas of living that would keep it alive, that was to make me skeptical of everything while seeking everything, tolerant of all and yet critical.” (Wright, 100) Wright’s incredible self-assurance comes through in his inner thoughts, but most significantly this determination triggers his interest in books. He says, “My reading had created a vast sense of distance between me and the world in which I lived and tried to make a living, and that sense of distance, was increasing each day.” (Wright, 253) Wright’s adjustment to an intellectual life is coupled with his family’s resistance to it. His Granny proclaims his first published work “the Devil’s work” (Wright, 168) and there is a general feeling of misunderstanding about his love of literature. This sense of having to prove himself to everyone forms Wright’s young radicalism, and makes him hope for a world where he can freely write. Washington’s call to “cast down your bucket where you are!” would not have fit in with this line of Wright’s thinking, and arguably this is due to his childhood feelings of isolation. As he enters the workforce, in order to make enough money to leave Jackson and his family, he begins to encounter more blatant racism, not simply the restrictive nature of his childhood.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">The nature of employment makes it a perfect setting for institutionalized racism and this is where we encounter DuBois and Washington’s main dilemma: what kind of jobs should African Americans be employed in? Washington believes in their ascent to equality through hard work in more menial positions, saying, “…our material prosperity, will bring into our beloved South a new heaven and a new earth.” (Washington, Atlanta Compromise) DuBois, in response to this, argues that Washington’s focus has been to “concentrate all their energies on industrial education, the accumulation of wealth, and the conciliation of the South.” (DuBois, Critique of Booker T. Washington) He advocates for higher education opportunities for African Americans and wants to create an elite class of educated blacks. Wright fits into this paradigm in an interesting way. On one hand, he is well spoken and an autodidact and is often mistaken for being more educated than he is. However, he does not share DuBois’ idealism, saying,</p>

			<p class="mb-2">I had no hope whatever of being a professional man. Not only had I been so conditioned that I did not desire it, but the fulfillment of such an ambition was beyond my capabilities. Well-to-do Negroes lived in a world that was almost as alien to me as the world inhabited by whites. (Wright, 253)</p>

			<p class="mb-2">In saying this, he fits into Washington’s ideology, valuing hard work and material prosperity. As Washington puts it, "Our greatest danger is that in the great leap from slavery to freedom we may overlook the fact that the masses of us are to live by the production of our hands…It is at the bottom of life we must begin, and not at the top. Nor should we permit our grievances to overshadow our opportunities. (Washington, Atlanta Compromise) This perspective is interesting when applied directly to Wright’s life, because though he works his way up the employment ladder, Wright would inherently disagree with Washington’s dismissal of “grievances,” seeing the value in pointing out unfairness and moral failings. Wright’s very essence, how he defines it, is what makes his life in unfair employment so challenging. He says, "I had begun coping with the white world too late. I could not make subservience an automatic part of my behavior. I had to feel and think out each tiny item of racial experience in the light of the whole race problem, and to each item I brought the whole of my life.... I could not react as the world in which I lived expected me to; that world was too baffling, too uncertain. (Wright, 196) Wright describes his life through the constant experience of having to hide how he is thinking and feeling. At one point, a classmate of his, Griggs, gives him this advice: “When you’re in front of white people, think before you act, think before you speak. Your way of doing things is all right among our people, but not for white people. They won’t stand for it.” (Wright, 184) Washington’s strategy of economic self-help, and accepting subordination within the system simply would not work for Wright, and that is the key to his success in being able to see through the motives of the Communist party.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">Wright’s experiences with the Communist Party are used as a way for him to once again emphasize his individuality. After numerous bad experiences within the party, he states, “I was termed a ‘bastard intellectual,’ an incipient Trotskyite…” (Wright, 351) and decides to cut ties with the party, saying that “I felt that the ground was being cut from under the feet of the party’s best writers.” (Wright, 355) For Wright, his value of writing is crucial to his understanding of progress. His values fit into DuBois’ platform of the unfair subjugation of artistic ability, as he says, “Our worst side has been so shamelessly emphasized that we are denying we have or ever had a worst side. In all sorts of ways we are hemmed in and our new young artists have got to fight their way to freedom.” (DuBois, 104, Critique of art) Wright’s story exemplifies this struggle, as he negotiates his role, first in order to learn, then to write, and to shape his relationship to the wider world in a positive way. Wright’s relationship with his racial identity is intensely personal, and reflected in his feelings of isolation and independence.  When he enters the workforce, he asks himself, "What would happen now that I would be among white people for hours at a stretch? Would they hit me? Curse me? If they did, I would leave at once. In all my wishing for a job I had not thought of how I would be treated, and now it loomed important, decisive, sweeping down beneath every other consideration. I would be polite, humble, say yes sir and no sir, yes ma’am and no ma’am, but I would draw a line over which they must not step." (Wright, 146) His own “line” is unique, and by his perception, very much his own. When confronted with Shorty, a bellhop who allows himself to be kicked in order to obtain money from white men, Wright reacts with an insistence that he personally cannot allow himself to be kicked. While Wright in many ways fits into Booker T. Washington’s ideals of hard work and determination, this instance shows that he refuses to fit into the current system of subordination. His isolation from his own community mirrors this as well. Halfway through his book, Wright says, “In all my life—though surrounded by many people—I had not had a single satisfying, sustained relationship with another human being and not having had any, I did not miss it. I made no demands whatever upon others.” (Wright, 261) This statement does seem to reflect his disassociation with his family, and possibly the ability to forget or ignore his relationship with his mother. However, it does inherently ring true that when Wright is confronted with a potential loving relationship through Bess and her mother, he rejects them, preferring to continue on his own. This individualism comes to a head when Wright parts with the Communist Party. He says, "At no time had I felt at home in the Communist party. I had always felt that the possibility was there, but always I was not quite sure of the motives of the people with whom I worked and they never seemed quite sure of mine. My comrades had known me, my family, my friends; they, God knows, had known my aching poverty. But they had never been able to conquer their fear of the individual way in which I acted and lived, an individuality which life had seared into my blood and bones." (Wright, 363) His reactions to institutionalized authority continue in the same vein for the entirety of his book. Wright does attempt to have a political presence, stating that he would “like to organize Negro artists” (Wright, 358) but his heart is elsewhere, as he puts it “I gritted my teeth as the daily value of pork chops was tabulated, longing to be at home with my writing.” (Wright, 359) Though Wright recognizes the immense importance of suffrage, his agenda is very much in the artistic realm, which differentiates him from both DuBois and Washington.</p>

			<p class="mb-2">Theorists such as DuBois and Washington provide interesting platforms on which to view Wright’s intensely personal experience. They set up a broader social and legal reality that exists in Wright’s world and that he responds to, but most importantly, in his personal case, they create space and opportunities for these dissenting opinions to be voiced. The last line of Wright’s book is, “I would send other words to tell, to march, to fight, to create a sense of the hunger for life that gnaws in us all, to keep alive in our hearts a sense of the inexpressibly human.” (Wright, 384) His progression throughout the book is clear; he has managed to see the usefulness of writing as substantively polemical. Earlier in his life it was something he had to hide, and nurture alone, but through his experiences with political organizing and activity, it has come to be part of his revolution, and while he may continue through life as a misanthrope, Richard Wright has recognized the value of his writing in a wider context.</p>
